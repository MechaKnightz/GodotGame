These models use texture coordinates to get their color! Turn off any texture interpolation
If exporting to Unreal or Unity be sure to set texture filtering (compression) to 0. (Nearest)

For Unity Users: When importing textures change compression to None, Filter Mode to Point (no filter) and Non-Power of 2 to None.
